# Nemesis - Rec Room Internal Cheat (2021 Legacy)

## About

**Nemesis** is an old internal Rec Room cheat that I recently found on my hard drive from 2021. The codebase was mostly intact, so I cleaned it up and updated the **ImGui** files to more modern versions for compatibility and visuals.

This project targets the **Rec Room** game and includes numerous internal hooks for gameplay manipulation, debug features, and more.

- ✔️ Built for **Release | x64**
- ✔️ Requires **MinHook** (Ive heard That Minhook Doesnt work I Mean Its old so idc)
- ❌ Not actively maintained — legacy archive
